                <p>Dr. Hosseini serves as an assistant professor in the computer science department and the director of UTSA’s Data-Driven Software Engineering Lab. Her research program focuses on specifying and designing software by leveraging existing data while adhering to policies and legal standards in a dependable and trustworthy manner. Historically, her work has delved into empirically extracting legal requirements from natural language policies, addressing the measurement and reasoning challenges associated with ambiguous and vague policies, and examining how experts and novices in security and privacy assess the risk associated with system designs. More recently, her endeavors include the utilization of Language Model Models (LLMs) to succinctly summarize software requirements and legal policies.</p>

				<h3>Research Projects</h3>

			<h5>Traceability Between Privacy Policies and Mobile Apps</h5>
			<p>Traceability between privacy policies and mobile apps refers to the ability to establish a clear connection or link between the privacy policies of a mobile app and the actual behaviors and practices implemented in the app. This traceability is crucial for ensuring transparency, compliance with privacy regulations, and building trust with users. This project is heavily reliant on natural langauge processing techniques. Establishing and maintaining traceability between privacy policies and mobile apps is an ongoing process that involves collaboration between legal, development, and privacy teams. It is crucial for both legal compliance and building trust with users who expect transparency and control over their personal information.
			</p>

			<h5>Maintaining Mobile Applications through Requirements Copilot</h5>
			<p>The popularity and usage of mobile applications (apps) among users have encouraged the industry to grow throughout many domains and categories. Mobile app development is similar to the traditional software development life cycle (SDLC). However, the requirements for mobile apps change rapidly and continuously. Further, these requirements can be introduced through constant feedback by end-users of mobile apps as a heterogeneous crowd in different geographical locations. Traditional requirement elicitation methods, such as interviews, workshops, and prototyping, can be successfully applied when stakeholders (including users) are within organizational reach. Therefore, the competitive mobile app development ecosystem presents unique challenges for developers in operating and maintaining the apps based on the continuously changing requirements, including enhancement, adaptation to new environments, compliance with new laws, and error correction. These challenges are further highlighted for small app-developing companies with limited resources and developers, which must address demanding development timelines to compete in the market. 
			</p>

			<h5>Privacy By Design in Cloud-based IoT Devices</h5>
			<p>
			The concept of privacy has expanded beyond worries about companies collecting user data, now encompassing interactions with various individuals and entities, leading to evolving privacy issues. This research aims to develop a privacy-by-design framework for cloud-based IoT systems. It seeks to ensure transparency in data handling, strong data control, and collaborative data management, with three specific tasks outlined for achieving this goal.
